MOON DWELLER: A text-based adventure in your web browser.

You've woken abruptly in a small, silver-walled room with no windows. There is a door to the east. What will you do? The choice is yours...

This project is dedicated to the memory of my friend Adam Hillier.

## History

This is a re-imagining of [Medieval Alien Massacre](https://github.com/buntine/Medieval-Alien-Massacre/), a text-based game I wrote back in 2010 in Clojure. I've ported it to ClojureScript here so it can run in the browser.

## Notes

 - Type the 'help' command in gameplay for some tips and instructions.
 - Inspired by Dunnet, by Rob Schnell ($ emacs -batch -l dunnet).
